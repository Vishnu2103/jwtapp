Chnage the visual design wit the same functionaltiy. Some pointers
Visual Design Language Template (Based on TextFX):

Overall Aesthetic:

Minimalist and clean.

Modern and tech-focused.

Slightly experimental and abstract.

Color Palette:

Dominant Theme: Dark Mode.

Backgrounds: Deep, dark colors â€“ primarily blacks, very dark grays, or deep saturated blues/purples.

Text: High contrast, typically white or light gray for maximum readability against the dark background.

Accents: Bright, vibrant, almost neon-like colors used sparingly. Think electric cyan, magenta, bright yellow, lime green. These are used for:

Interactive elements (buttons, sliders, links).

Highlighting active states or selected items.

Icons.

Subtle background gradients or graphic elements.

Potentially unique accent colors defining individual tool sections.

Typography:

Font Style: Clean, modern sans-serif fonts. Legible and neutral.

Hierarchy: Clear distinction between different text elements:

Large, prominent headings for tool names or section titles.

Readable body text size for descriptions, input fields, and output results.

Possibly smaller text for secondary information or labels.

Weight & Case: Primarily uses regular font weights, possibly bold for emphasis or headings. Sentence case or title case used appropriately.

Layout & Spacing:

Structure: Simple, often single-column or straightforward two-column layouts, especially on tool pages. Focuses user attention on the task flow (input -> controls -> output).

Grid/Cards: Homepage or tool selection might use a grid or card-based layout to present the different options clearly.

Whitespace: Generous use of negative space (padding and margins) to prevent clutter and improve focus. Creates a feeling of spaciousness despite the dark theme.

Responsiveness: Layout adapts fluidly to different screen sizes, maintaining clarity and usability on mobile and desktop.

Graphics & Imagery:

Iconography: Simple, symbolic line icons, often using the bright accent colors. Each icon visually represents the function of a tool.

Geometric Elements: Use of abstract geometric shapes, lines, or subtle patterns, sometimes animated gently in the background (e.g., flowing lines, soft particle effects).

Photography/Illustrations: Minimal to no use of traditional photography or complex illustrations. The focus is on typography, color, and abstract graphics.

Dividers: Simple lines or subtle changes in background color/texture to separate sections.

Interaction Cues:

Hover States: Clear visual feedback when hovering over interactive elements (e.g., color change, slight scaling, background highlight).

Focus States: Visible outlines or style changes for focused elements (important for accessibility).

Loading Indicators: Simple animations (spinners, pulsing effects) using accent colors during processing.
